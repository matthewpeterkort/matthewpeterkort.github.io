<h2> Research Software Engineer, Value Investing Studier, Starcraft II Player, Swimmer, Avid Reader, Poker Enjoyer </h2>
<p>What are we here for? What will I regret when I am near death? How can I better myself?
Where is the meaning in all of this?</p>
<p>These are the somewhat large questions my Non Fiction reading journey aims to accomplish.</p>
<img alt="Photo" fetchpriority="high" width="1125" height="750" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="next-image" style="color:transparent" src="/images/GrayTrees.jpg"/>
<p>In October 2022 I started working in Portland, Oregon full time as a research Software Engineer as my first software job out of college.
I didn&#x27;t want to get a place close to work yet or take care of a car.
So instead I commute in to work via MAX everyday. This leaves me with around 120 minutes of time to read everyday.</p>
<p>In college I didn&#x27;t really study too much liberal arts, or philosophy or religion or ideological constructs that would help answer these big questions. I had to study them on my own and reach my own conclusions.
But I was out of college now. This 4 year slog of just trying to pass the class, learn some stuff, program some stuff,  get a job, and get out of University was over.</p>
<p>And what was ahead of me? 45+ years of full time work.</p>
<p>A couple weeks before I had witnessed my grandfather&#x27;s last breaths alive. He died at 93 of natural causes. I remember sitting in one of the front pews of the church at his funeral watching some orthodox
clergymen go through their usual funeral service when when a wave of anxiety hit me. Although it might not seem like it in my youth, I am going to die one day.</p>
<p>Echoes of the famous Metal Gear Solid 5 quote &quot;Why are we here, just to suffer?&quot; manifested the foundation of my journey of finding meaning from those who have existed before us.
After all there is a wealth of knowledge that can be learned from written history, that most people tend to take for granted.</p>
<p>Faced with this intangibley large unit of my life being subjugated by the 40 hour work week + a 10 hour commute week (at least for the time being) I realized I needed to find some meaning to the human condition of
living on a floating rock hurling through seemingly empty space so that I could direct my efforts with purpose and find meaning in the routine monotony of life that was ahead of me.</p>
<p>So the purpose of this Site is to communicate my learnings / insights from my readings and also learn a little bit of web dev / take some photos / have an excuse to write.</p>
<p>Non Ficiton Philosopophy, History, Life Advice, Religion and Finance books are my main genre interests. I still struggle with fiction because it is not real. I need the facts.
I need a story that actually happened, or at least that millions of people believe happened.</p>
<p>2024 EDIT:</p>
<p>Literature is interesting too i suppose.</p><footer class="jsx-2447ca1c11803f07"><small class="jsx-2447ca1c11803f07"><time class="jsx-2447ca1c11803f07">2024</time> Â© MAX BOOK BYTES</small></footer></article></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/photos","query":{},"buildId":"QHL_Jl-Cibr3LPUMuEN8z","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
