Some people like to say that stoicism\nis accepting the fact that as part of nature, you will have to take the ultimate L of dying, and it teaches you have to lose on your own terms.\nI'm not eplaining this very well. The hardest part to me about stoicism is recognizing what is in your control and what isn't.  The stoics never really\nexplain this very well. They seem to be better at explaining how to cope with the Losses. There are points in this book when you just stop reading and think about what\nEpictetus is saying because there are alot of quotable lines in this book. It's not all sunshines and rainbows, there are boring parts, but I strongly\nrecommend this book to anyone trying to understand stoicism.
