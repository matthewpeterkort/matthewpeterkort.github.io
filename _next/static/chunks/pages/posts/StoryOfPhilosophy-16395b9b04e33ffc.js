In this book Will Durant attempts to connect a dozen different philosophers together through a\n"Philosopher Family Tree" of belief systems. He called it "The Table of Philosophic Affiliations". On the left side of the table you have\nthe stoics, on the right you have the epicureans, and in the middle you have the logicians. In this book Durant uses Nietszhe as his stoic\ndescendant, Kant as his logician descendant, and Voltaire as his epicurean discendant. These are the core people that he spends the most pages\ncovering. He fills the cracks with Lesser known philosophers like James, Russel, Bergson, Spencer, Corce, Bacon, Santayana, Spinoza, Dewey,\nSchopenhauer.
