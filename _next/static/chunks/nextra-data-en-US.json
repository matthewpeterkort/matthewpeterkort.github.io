What will I regret when I am near death? How can I better myself?\nWhere is the meaning in all of this?These are the somewhat large questions my Non Fiction reading journey aims to accomplish.\n\nIn October 2022 I started working in Portland, Oregon full time as a research Software Engineer as my first software job out of college.\nI didn't want to get a place close to work yet or take care of a car.\nSo instead I commute in to work via MAX everyday. This leaves me with around 120 minutes of time to read everyday.In college I didn't really study too much liberal arts, or philosophy or religion or ideological constructs that would help answer these big questions. I had to study them on my own and reach my own conclusions.\nBut I was out of college now. This 4 year slog of just trying to pass the class, learn some stuff, program some stuff,  get a job, and get out of University was over.And what was ahead of me? 45+ years of full time work.A couple weeks before I had witnessed my grandfather's last breaths alive. He died at 93 of natural causes. I remember sitting in one of the front pews of the church at his funeral watching some orthodox\nclergymen go through their usual funeral service when when a wave of anxiety hit me. Although it might not seem like it in my youth, I am going to die one day.Echoes of the famous Metal Gear Solid 5 quote \"Why are we here, just to suffer?\" manifested the foundation of my journey of finding meaning from those who have existed before us.\nAfter all there is a wealth of knowledge that can be learned from written history, that most people tend to take for granted.Faced with this intangibley large unit of my life being subjugated by the 40 hour work week + a 10 hour commute week (at least for the time being) I realized I needed to find some meaning to the human condition of\nliving on a floating rock hurling through seemingly empty space so that I could direct my efforts with purpose and find meaning in the routine monotony of life that was ahead of me.So the purpose of this Site is to communicate my learnings / insights from my readings and also learn a little bit of web dev / take some photos / have an excuse to write.Non Ficiton Philosopophy, History, Life Advice, Religion and Finance books are my main genre interests. I still struggle with fiction because it is not real. I need the facts.\nI need a story that actually happened, or at least that millions of people believe happened."}},"/posts/Alone":{"title":"How to Not Die Alone - Logan Ury","data":{"":"I should preface this by saying that I have read many different books in this self-improvement/dating genre. They all mostly say the same things, reference the same studies, and are structured in the same way. This book is no different\nthan the rest in most respects. The differences are that in this book she gives good advice on how to go about meeting new people, how to figure out if somebody is marriagable, and how to identify your greatest dating weaknesses.Its a very well written book. In fact one of the better written dating books that I have read. It is definately aimed more at women than men. It's not going to tell you that you have to stick to some strict gym regime but it will tell\nyou to buy clothes that fit you well, have realistic expectations in considering potential partners, and to be consciously deliberate in how you manage your dating life. I enjoyed it.I rate this book 10/10 in readabilitiy and qualitatively,  Red Flower/10"}},"/posts/Cesar":{"title":"Cesar and Christ - Will Durant","data":{"":"This is a good book. But it's long. Really long. I'm only 400/600 pages after 2 weeks and the pages are big and tall. somewhat solid MAX reading. The book will conquer the casual reader. It is something you must commit to. There is a lot of interstesting Roman Republic - Roman Emperors societal/ narrative / cultural information in this book that is surprisingly similar to present day society. It's amazing what can be learned from the past. Definately worth a read if you are dedicated for the challenge.I probably have another week left on it at a least. But it's good, and it's well written and it teaches you alot about ancient way of life. It really makes you think at times. What I like about this book is it really gives you a feel for the times by giving an all encompassing account of society. It talks about art, warefare, economics, politics, societal structure, campaigns, election cycles, conquest, contextual information, describes major events and why they happened as they did, etc. Most pages are worth reading, Although it is alot to read. I never thought I would pick this book up but I don't really regret the time I have put into it.The last third of this book talks about the rise of christianty and the struggles of the Jews in the holy land during the later stages of the roman monarchy. It's interesting, but it seems like this is the place where Durant holds the most aback. It's hard to know exactly why the Roman empire was so captivated by christianty, considering how new of a religion it was at the time. I guess considering that many of the ancient roman stoics and greek logicians already believed in the concept of a higher power/ god it wasn't too hard to transition into a more structured, welcoming, formalizied, popular, relgion. The last part of the book definately leaves a bit to be desired It would have been nice if Durant talked a bit more about it.This book gets a photo rating of \"Pretty Stump\". It's a book that is oldish, and there are places where you can tell that the writing style is dated, but it is still for the most part relevent. You know that back in the day this book was a really big deal but it has since been chopped down and swallowed by the winds of time. It's too bad because it really does a good job of explaining history in a way that is actually digestable. You know that it was in fact a nice tree at one point but all that remains is a pretty stump. Unfortunate.I rate this book 10/10 in readabilitiy and qualitatively,  Red Flower/10"}},"/posts/January":{"title":"January Cluster Read --> Lao Tzu- Tao Te Ching, Marx and Engels- Communist Manifesto, Cicero- On Life and Death, Seneca- Letters from a Stoic, Epictetus- Discourses and selected Writings","data":{"":"Lao Tzu- Tao Te Ching\nDidn't get too much out of this book. Even with the long introduction talking about the concept of taoism,\nIt just didn't make much sense to me. It felt like stoicism + follow superiors + conform to society. The text\nitself is pretty short and chock full with contradictions. Not a total waste of time, but I don't think I'm\nthe type of person that can really get much out of taoism. But not going to judge it off of one book,\ntheres probably more to it but I'm not motivated to find out and read more taoist works.3/10... not my cup of tea\nMarx and Engels- Communist Manifesto\n\n\n\nPengiun Classics Communist Manifesto Amazon Buy Link\nThis one was quite interesting. The introduction was 180 pages and it talked about the European poltical cimate\nin the mid 1800s and why these marxist ideas were formed/ how they were formed and how/why they got popular.\nThe text itself isn't really my cup of tea. Sure if you've been delt a terrible hand in life and don't have much\nto make it great communism can be appealing but in general if you have a good path in your life it's hard to think that\nyou should believe in this type of thing. Now granted back then the standard of living was much worse for the majority of the\nworking populace, so it would make sense why this ideology was more powerful. But it's not like communism hadn't been tried many many\ncountries. Then end result is usually mass starvation/famine/death. It's a utopia that goes against all human nature.I can see how this book could normally be quite boring. But, with the 200 page introduction I now understand alot more about the physical text itself\nand the whole reading experience/context really helps enjoy this piece of history.Great theoretically, not as great in practice 7.1/10, C-\nCicero- On Life and Death\nThis book was good, but it was a bit hard to read. The back half of it was more intersting. I didn't get much out of the\nfirst part Tuscan Disputations. I would rank this a C grade Stoic text. There are better stoic works. This one fallows the format\nof a guided conversation to Atticus and Bfutus, which makes it feel more like a Plato's Republic style of work.\nNot my favorite type of writing style. Overall it explains most of the guiding principles of stoicism, but I wouldn't recommend it\nas a first stoic book. Cicero spends most of this book reflecting on his life in Roman Society while trying to advise younger\nreads how to live their lives.Mid Mid Mid Mid Mid Mid Mid Mid 4/10\nSeneca- Letters from a Stoic\nThis book I really didn't get much out of. People say that you must read alot of philsophy and then come back to this book to get any\nkind of understanding. I assure you I read every word and every sentence and every paragraph, but I cannot really tell you about any of the\nthoughts/ideas that they conveyed. Most of the letters were pretty short or uninteresting so I really didn't end up picking up much from this.\nI think it also doesn't help that letters in general are usually very dependant on contextual facts and interpersonal relations between people.\nThese are two things that I don't really know how to attain from a text written 2000+ years ago. Would not recommend this book unless you\nhave read alot on stoicism/ancient roman culture and now about everything that is going on in Rome at the time.This book was definately a fly-over for me. Maybe one day I'll read this again after I have read many more books from this era. 2/10\nEpictetus- Discourses and selected Writings\nThis book was great! probably the 2nd best stoic text I ever read behind meditations. Epictetus just knows how to write.\nOr maybe the translation is really good. I think after I read this book I felt alot better about the concept of death.\nFor a long time I was bothered by it but I think this book really helped me out alot. Some people like to say that stoicism\nis accepting the fact that as part of nature, you will have to take the ultimate L of dying, and it teaches you have to lose on your own terms.\nI'm not eplaining this very well. The hardest part to me about stoicism is recognizing what is in your control and what isn't.  The stoics never really\nexplain this very well. They seem to be better at explaining how to cope with the Losses. There are points in this book when you just stop reading and think about what\nEpictetus is saying because there are alot of quotable lines in this book. It's not all sunshines and rainbows, there are boring parts, but I strongly\nrecommend this book to anyone trying to understand stoicism. Like most philosophical books you really have to take your time reading it to understand what is\nbeing said but I think for this book it is actually worth doing.Exceptional, 2nd to only Meditations. 9/10"}},"/posts/StoryOfPhilosophy":{"title":"The Story of Philosophy - Will Durant","data":{"":"This book was a decent read. In this book Will Durant attempts to connect a dozen different philosophers together through a\n\"Philosopher Family Tree\" of belief systems. He called it \"The Table of Philosophic Affiliations\". On the left side of the table you have\nthe stoics, on the right you have the epicureans, and in the middle you have the logicians. In this book Durant uses Nietszhe as his stoic\ndescendant, Kant as his logician descendant, and Voltaire as his epicurean discendant. These are the core people that he spends the most pages\ncovering. He fills the cracks with Lesser known philosophers like James, Russel, Bergson, Spencer, Corce, Bacon, Santayana, Spinoza, Dewey,\nSchopenhauer. People that were important in their day for slowly progressing philosophical concepts, but not really people that I remember reading\ntoo much about despite mindlessly covering some 300 pages of their boring lives.Usually something about how they were the brave on the face the church with mild criticisims that were viewed as total heresy back in the day, or some biography about how their early childhood traumas shaped\nthey nihilistic beliefs. It was interesting reading structurally because Durant always tells of the philosopher's life before he talks about their\nbeliefs as to provide life's context to their beliefs allowing the reader to more thoroughly understand the reasons behind their  beliefs.The chapter on Voltaire was the most interesting because he was more of a playwrite than a philosopher but, the dude seemed to have the ultimate\nskill of finessing the leaders into his favor even when he finds himself in trouble with the authorities. It was pretty common for philopsophers to\nget in trouble with a new ruler/ fall out of favor because their influence can be quite strong and their beliefs don't always allign with the ruling\nparty/ person of the land. But Voltaire could almost always finesse himself to victory.The Kant chapter was pretty incomprehensible. But then again I don't understand Hegel either. Nietzsche is the most easily understood german philosopher\nout of all of the german philopsophers of that era in my opinionThere is a lot in this book, and I'd say a good 30-40% of it went over my head or was not comprehended. It's not the easiest read but it's also not terrible either.Readability: 5/10Picture: SnowyTree/10"}},"/posts":{"title":"Posts","data":{"":""}},"/tags/[tag]":{"title":"Tagged Posts","data":{"":""}}}
