The problem with this book is that it put me to sleep in many sections. The way that this guy writes is just plain predictable. Because of this I stumbled through this book with not much effort
skipping parts of paragraphs at will. I can't even remember the core argument that he was trying to make except saying that modern society is getting too soft. After 
reading 3 random pages of the book to jog my memory I guess his main argument was that modern society needs to lean on traditionalist values in order to preserve order and functionality.
Again not a super attractive book for modern minds. And oncemore there are some things in this book that are not really acceptable in modern society. 
Read it and find out but probably don't because it's a hard one to get through. 

This book gets a photo rating of "Undesirable Apple". It's not bad, you can eat it, but just like the look of that apple in the photo you will also not be so sad if it stays on the tree, falls 
down and decomposes. there are better apples out there. 

Rating 5/10 Readability 7/10  Photo Score Undesirable Apple/10
