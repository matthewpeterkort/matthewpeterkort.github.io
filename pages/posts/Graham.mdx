This book is legend status. Never have I read something that so eloquently teaches you to not be an Ape, think for yourself, don't be sheepish with your money, do your own reserach, and other timeless investing principles.
I still have around 100 pages left in this book but it is beginning to wind down and I really must say it was an interesting one. It talks about how companies like to riddle their financial reports with fine print and it talks about 
how to recognize price bubbles when they come. It talks alot about the tech bubble and all of the irationalities that got alot of people into alot of trouble. 

Just a good overall book on investing. Not going to teach you about indicators, or super specific stock analysis, but like it promises if you follow the teachings of the book the worst that will happen is that you will not make any money. 
You will not lose huge amounts of money doing Graham's strategies. That's his whole deal is he teaches how to mitigate risk in a very risky place like the stock market. It's a good read.

It can feel grindy/ boring at times, but it's worth reading in my opinion.

This book gets a photo rating of "Blue Sky". It's a book that will make your investing future a blue sky of limitless posibilities if you take most of what is being said to heart. 
It's not going to make you rich tomorrow but it will help you not make any catastrophic mistakes.

Rating 8/10 Readability 10/10  Photo Score Blue Sky/10
