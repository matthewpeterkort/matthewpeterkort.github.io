This is a good book. But it's long. Really long. I'm only 400/600 pages after 2 weeks and the pages are big and tall. somewhat solid MAX reading. The book will conquer the casual reader. It is something you must commit to. There is a lot of interstesting Roman Republic - Roman Emperors societal/ narrative / cultural information in this book that is surprisingly similar to present day society. It's amazing what can be learned from the past. Definately worth a read if you are dedicated for the challenge.

I probably have another week left on it at a least. But it's good, and it's well written and it teaches you alot about ancient way of life. It really makes you think at times. What I like about this book is it really gives you a feel for the times by giving an all encompassing account of society. It talks about art, warefare, economics, politics, societal structure, campaigns, election cycles, conquest, contextual information, describes major events and why they happened as they did, etc. Most pages are worth reading, Although it is alot to read. I never thought I would pick this book up but I don't really regret the time I have put into it.

The last third of this book talks about the rise of christianty and the struggles of the Jews in the holy land during the later stages of the roman monarchy. It's interesting, but it seems like this is the place where Durant holds the most aback. It's hard to know exactly why the Roman empire was so captivated by christianty, considering how new of a religion it was at the time. I guess considering that many of the ancient roman stoics and greek logicians already believed in the concept of a higher power/ god it wasn't too hard to transition into a more structured, welcoming, formalizied, popular, relgion. The last part of the book definately leaves a bit to be desired It would have been nice if Durant talked a bit more about it.

This book gets a photo rating of "Pretty Stump". It's a book that is oldish, and there are places where you can tell that the writing style is dated, but it is still for the most part relevent. You know that back in the day this book was a really big deal but it has since been chopped down and swallowed by the winds of time. It's too bad because it really does a good job of explaining history in a way that is actually digestable. You know that it was in fact a nice tree at one point but all that remains is a pretty stump. Unfortunate. 

I rate this book 10/10 in readabilitiy and qualitatively,  Red Flower/10
