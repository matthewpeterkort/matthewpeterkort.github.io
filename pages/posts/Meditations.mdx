Although this book is short, the beginning few pages were hard for me to get through. Once the book gets going Marcus Aurelius explains 
to the reader his viewpoints on life and life after death. Marcus explains that if there is any afterlife, life on earth would be very short
comparatively. He also seemed to think that you would be judged morally on your mortal actions on earth. Because of this the major point he talks about in this book is showing
kindness and making your time on earth as productive and useful as possible. He claims that almost everyone has a consciousness  and a sense of morality and since everyone will die eventually \
you need to maximize your positive impact on society. He also liked to stress that death is coming so you should live every day
with this assertive drive to do good for others, and society. You get a real feeling like Marcus in writing this book is coming to grips with the fact that death is part of the natural processes of 
life. This book was short but In my opinion, it was worth reading, maybe even more than once. It was not very religious, it mostly just preached western greek and roman value systems.

I was getting strong "Tall-Tree". Marcus was a very tall tree in Ancient Roman Society, but even trees have a finite lifespan and will die of natural causes eventually if not taken out 
by non-natural causes.
