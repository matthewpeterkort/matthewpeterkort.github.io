Read this book for work. The beginning was easy reading, but around halfway through the book just gets plain monotonous. 
Ambitious Cancer Scientist X discovers Y advancement onto cancer That Yields Z result that holistically yields small progressions in cancer treatment advancements. 
The book is downright depressing. But I guess such is the nature of Cancer treatment. More people die from it or die with it in their system than beat it. Cells 
mutate with time and there is little that one can do to prevent it even if they stay away from known carcinogens.


That said, the book is quite educational on the history of cancer. It explains how historically, some researchers were stopped from making advancements 
because of peanut butter-thick paradigms that could not be breached until new generations of trail-blazing young minds were able to 	 prove superior methods and practices.
The greatest takeaway I got from this book is the fragility of life. One day you could be going about your status quo and the next you are finding out that you have 6 months to live
because you had cancer that has metastisized to half of your body.


This book gets a photo rating of "Pretty Plant". Throughout history cancer was not even talked about because most people didn't live long enough to die from it. Even still
until modern times, there was no effective treatments or therapies for cancer. At least nowadays there are a few cancers that have positive prognoses. So in essence from reading this book
it appears as though we are in the pretty plant stage of cancer research development. Soon it might even be flowering who knows.
