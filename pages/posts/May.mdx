<h4> Atlas Shrugged - Ayn Rand </h4>

This book felt like more of a chore to read than fountainhead. 

The issue with Rand's writing style is that she refuses build up another strong female character
other than herself in the Novel. As a result of this you end up with about 450 pages of garbage where Rand's
'chosen' female character slowly procures a roster of ultra successful men willing to do anything for her. It's 
just not that realistic.

It was a bit of a difficult read. I think if Rand stopped fantasy writing and cut 450 pages off of the book that doesn't really
contain core plot anyway, the principles of this book would have carried with the reader throughout the book much better, creating a more powerful effect on the reader. 
Rand has some very interesting philosophical takes with her 'objectivism' but in many places it gets sacrificed for her own writing pleasures.

90% of this book gets distilled down into one speech at the end of the book laying out Rand's core beliefs and world view. That speech is worth reading.
Everything else is optional examples illustrating Rand's core points, all to be tied together at the end of the book.

There were parts of this book that were quite well done, but I suspect for most people it is not worth sifting through the trash to find the treasure,
ex: James Taggart's wife arc, Ragnar Danneskjold character, the motor quest / 20th century motor company story, John Galt origin story.

Very powerful ideas, decent plot progression, tone and setting, but the book lacks focus in many places.
