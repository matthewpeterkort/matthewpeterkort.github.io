This book was a decent read. In this book Will Durant attempts to connect a dozen different philosophers together through a 
"Philosopher Family Tree" of belief systems. He called it "The Table of Philosophic Affiliations". On the left side of the table you have 
the stoics, on the right you have the epicureans, and in the middle you have the logicians. In this book Durant uses Nietszhe as his stoic
descendant, Kant as his logician descendant, and Voltaire as his epicurean discendant. These are the core people that he spends the most pages
covering. He fills the cracks with Lesser known philosophers like James, Russel, Bergson, Spencer, Corce, Bacon, Santayana, Spinoza, Dewey, 
Schopenhauer. People that were important in their day for slowly progressing philosophical concepts, but not really people that I remember reading
too much about despite mindlessly covering some 300 pages of their boring lives. 

Usually something about how they were the brave on the face the church with mild criticisims that were viewed as total heresy back in the day, or some biography about how their early childhood traumas shaped 
they nihilistic beliefs. It was interesting reading structurally because Durant always tells of the philosopher's life before he talks about their
beliefs as to provide life's context to their beliefs allowing the reader to more thoroughly understand the reasons behind their  beliefs. 

The chapter on Voltaire was the most interesting because he was more of a playwrite than a philosopher but, the dude seemed to have the ultimate
skill of finessing the leaders into his favor even when he finds himself in trouble with the authorities. It was pretty common for philopsophers to 
get in trouble with a new ruler/ fall out of favor because their influence can be quite strong and their beliefs don't always allign with the ruling
party/ person of the land. But Voltaire could almost always finesse himself to victory.

The Kant chapter was pretty incomprehensible. But then again I don't understand Hegel either. Nietzsche is the most easily understood german philosopher 
out of all of the german philopsophers of that era in my opinion

There is a lot in this book, and I'd say a good 30-40% of it went over my head or was not comprehended. It's not the easiest read but it's also not terrible either.

Readability: 5/10
