This book was actually very interesting. Half of it details the history of the American financial system from the founding of the Federal Reserve in 1913 to the 2008 housing crisis. It talks about Nixon, Greenspan, Bernanke, and 
how we are at the precipice of a huge recession and maybe even a depression. Was a good intro book into modern monitary theory. Not going to pretend like I understood everything in this book perfectly, but It gives some perspective
to what exactly is money and why debt and interest rates are so important in the modern financial system. I would definately recommend this book.

This book gets a photo rating of "Long Grass". It's almost ready to be cut and when the grass gets cut a whole bunch of government debt disappears and the Bull market restarts again.
The central bank is a complicated topic. I'm not the one to explain it. Read the book if you're interested. It's well written and explains everything in laymen's terms.  

Rating 8/10 Readability 10/10  Photo Score Long Grass/10
