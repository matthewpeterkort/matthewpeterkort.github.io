Machiavelli was a man that was living during the dark ages of Italy. He had a somewhat failed political career and was a bit of a bitter man. Alot of the political failings of Italy and the church at that 
time to stave off foreign invaders, and the reasons why the Princes of Italy had failed at the time made good sense to me. He made alot of good points in this book.

Of course he also said alot of very unacceptable heinous practices about how to treat people that I will not go into detail about. You will have to read the book yourself if you are curious.
Overall the book teaches you a bit about the history in Europe around the 1400-1500s and that was rather interesting to me. 

This book gets a photo rating of "Old Dismembered sink plumbing". The dude was dripping some facts, and no doubt at one time was functioning in society 
but at the end of the day I think of old dismembered sink plumbing when i think of this book.

Rating 5/10 Readability 5/10  Photo Score Old Dismembered Faucet/10
