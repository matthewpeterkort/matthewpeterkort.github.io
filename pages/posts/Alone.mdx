I should preface this by saying that I have read many different books in this self-improvement/dating genre. They all mostly say the same things, reference the same studies, and are structured in the same way. This book is no different
than the rest in most respects. The differences are that in this book she gives good advice on how to go about meeting new people, how to figure out if somebody is marriagable, and how to identify your greatest dating weaknesses.   

Its a very well written book. In fact one of the better written dating books that I have read. It is definately aimed more at women than men. It's not going to tell you that you have to stick to some strict gym regime but it will tell
you to buy clothes that fit you well, have realistic expectations in considering potential partners, and to be consciously deliberate in how you manage your dating life. I enjoyed it. 

I rate this book 10/10 in readabilitiy and qualitatively,  Red Flower/10
