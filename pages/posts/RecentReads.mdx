Much can be learned about the impact of an event in one's life from the acuity of the memory of it. Writing this summary many months later I reflect on my time reading the Age of Faith as a painful one.

Will Durant's 1200 page saga "The Age of Faith" forced me to look at fiction in a light that I hadn't before". Although incredibally well written and factual, reading the text itself was marginally more
exciting than staring out the window of the MAX train car into the dark morning twighlight countryside. Although I learned alot about the middle ages, I didn't learn much new, or insightful information.

just after reading age of faith I told myself I would right Durant's last work that went unpublished for many years before a relative digged it out of a dusty atic.

Will Durant- Fallen Leaves. Last words on Life, Love, War, God.
This book didn't leave much of an impression on me. Will Durant was a classical acedemic. Skeptical of the existance of a god, and incredibly objective and talented at the craft. He had an ability
to summarize and synthesize history that is unmatched, and I would argue many of his works have withstood the test of time. For now. But they are not entertaining.

And thus ends the pain and suffering of reading Will Durant. Cesar and Christ was probably his most interesting work. 

In between Durant and The beginning of my 1800s Russian Literature Journey I read a somewaht boring textbook titled:
Introduction to Bioinformatics - Arthur M Lesk, because I thought it would give me more background on the biology of the data science part of my job that I do. Since I mostly do Software Engineering stuff I don't
usually end up doing data science/ bioinformatics, but alot of the data that coworkers around me use and analyze is oftentimes "bioinformatics" type data. Sequence alignments, Drug Response, Metabolic Pathways, Transcriptomics, Regulatory networks. 
Not super interested in biology as a whole but I do find the complexity of data analysis required to make meaningful decisions/ synthesis very interesting. Cancer often seems like a great noble challenge that few dare
to be buredened with and many have failed to find solutions to in the past. Oncology and Bioinformatics are not the same but they do have some overlap especially where I work. I don't think I'll be reading another bioinformatics textbook for awhile.

The Fyodor Dostoevsky Saga (Devils, Crime and Punishment, The Idiot : June,July):

I like this author. Dude had the poor 1800s Russian man life. Grow up dirt poor, work in siberia labor camp for 10 years. Then somehow find success as a proflific author in the later years of life.
You really get an appreciation for how you've got it when you read his books. Really really depressing, but humbling at the same time. He makes the most compelling arguments for monotheistic religion I have ever read.
This author single handedly changed my opinion on fiction and literature. Growing up, throughought elementary, middle and high school the books I was forced to read I had no interest in. Not a single strong, powerful male protagonist. ever. 
Nobody I could relate to or strive to be like. Often childish or just straightup feminine themed books, or coming of age stories which were my personal least favorite.
With 1 exception. 1984 left an incredibly strong impression on me and I am very greatful that I was forced to read it at such a young age.

Dostoevsky is not easy to read. Many of his characters go by 2-3 different names and he often has 10+ characters that play a significant part in the novel.

Devils- This was the first Dostoevsky book I read and it was by far the most depressing/bloodiest. At the backhalf of the book there is practically death on every page. The author slowly details the destruction of a small town by the seems of its moral fabric with such accuracy and realism that
you are oftentimes left with a feeling of total gratitude and a desire to do good in the world and be a person of high moral stature as you are shown the affects of society when these standards are not upheld and evil lurks in every corner.
This book does not have a happy ending. It is not meant to be entertaining. It is a critique on nihilist russian society, and a good one at that.

Crime and Punishment- There is a reason why this is his most popular work. It is structured into 5 digestible parts and it builds into a somewhat "Russian" style happy ending at the end, or about as much of a happy ending as you will ever
get from this dude. It builds well and overall is a decent read but the middle of the book is a bit slow and unimpressionable. Most of the book is spent illustrating the mental breakdown of an incompetant killer who got really lucky and
cannot deal with the mental consequences of his consciousness and knowing that he must be punished for his crimes. Mid.

The Idiot- This one is harder to read than the others. The whole book revolves around the interactions created when one places an Idiot antihero playing a wealthy, autistic, morally jesus like figure into a Sodom and Gomorrah type Russian nihilist society. So basically you spend 500 pages reading about the idiot trying
to win over a women for marriage, but he's a high value idiot so he doesn't realize he could wife up any of the women in the book if he wanted to. By the end of the book one thing is clear. The reader is the idiot for reading the whole thing. Yes,
it is entertaining, but the middle of the book drags, and the end of the book is nothing short of a disappointment. Still, many of the themes present in Dostoevsky's other books are prominantly featured in this novel. And it's still 5x more interesting than Will Durant. Like I have said
this guy makes the strongest argument for religion I have ever read.

I'm currently over halfway through Anna Karenina -Tolstoy. Tolstoy writes much more approachably and conventional than Dostoevsky. I'm not sure how to think about him. Although he writes well structured, well developed,
"classical" literature with the same moralist themes and communist critiques that Dostoevsky also sports, it is much more subtley communicated. I like Dostoevsky's style better. Tolstoy was rich and it shows in his writing.
You don't get that same type of all access experience to the daily life of the peasant lifestyle like you do with Dostoevsky. Still good, entertaining, but I don't think I'm going to be reading War and Peace next.
Not going to fully judge this book untill I've read it in its entiriety so let's leave it at that.
