<h4> Brave New World - Aldous Huxley </h4>

This book wasn't very much like anything I had ever read before. You can tell Orwell took alot from Huxley 
in writing 1984, and I cannot help but consider this book as a weaker predecessor to it. That said this book is unique 
in its own right.

Huxley paints a dystopia of utilitarian totalitarian government in which certain classes of human exist that are bread for their
certain positions in society, in which the nuclear family has been abolished and dope and sex are all that anybody lives for.
Very few have the ability to do any critical thinking and those that do often get killed or exiled to islands.

The whole tone of the book is quite depressing. Not as depressing as some Russian literature I have read previously but it 
is up there. Worth reading if you like this sort of book, but overall I'd say that 1984 did most things better without the 
wierd orgy soceity being one of the major points of the book.  

The plot and storyline was clever but beyond that it was just Meh. You could read you could not read it. 

C+ / B- territory 

<h4> The Master & Margarita - Mikhail Bulgakov </h4>

I did not understand this book at all. It almost felt like somebody glued together 10 seemingly unrelated stories with roughly the same characters
together and called it a novel. I'm sure I missed alot from this book, but I couldn't tell you what. 

The book revolves around satan, and his cat and henchman going around trolling / messing with people, and eventually welcoming margarita into their world for a short stay. There is a plot arc that 
is much much deeper than that involving one man who gets trolled pretty badly and another man who tries to wade through the waters of evil, but that wasn't the fun part of this book.
I've heard this book makes more sense if you were living in USSR during Stalin times, but I'd have to live that to know that.  

I'm sure if you enjoy the fantasy elements of this cat doing impossible things like drinking vodka with the homies and having full on 
conversations with average citizens of Moscow then maybe you'de enjoy it a bit more than I did. The entire book seemed like one big long
trip to clownworld to me. I'm probably too based in reality to get this one.

Can't give this a fair rating. No Rating.

<h4> The Fountainhead - Ayn Rand </h4>

I could write alot about this book but I think that in Rands somewhat concise writing style I will try to keep it short.
Rand is outlining a philosophy in this book better than most of the philosophical texts I have read so far with 5 characters:

Howard Roark, a unapolagetic contrarian individualist (protagonist)

Peter Keating, an NPC with little will, original thought or conviction, who will do anything for success (tragic hero #1)

Dominique, an ambitious beautiful young women who spends most of the book grappling with that hard choice of deciding what man stay with for life (Rand projecting)

Gale Wynand, a strong intelligent man who will do anything for power (tragic hero #2)

Ellsworth Toohey, the guiding light of virtue, kindness and the establishment (Villian)

Most of the book is spent describing these character archetypes. Rand is arguing about the merits of 
individualist accomplishment and spends most of the book preeching the merits of selishness and individual 
honement of skills as a way of making the greatest contributions to society.

I would say her two core points are:

Those who wish to attain power in society must be willing to actively do evil.
Those who wish to leave the greatest legacy for humanity must be uncompromising stout individualist contrarians.

The whole entire book builds to a end speech by Roark who defends the choices he has made throughout the 
book by laying out his core philosophy, the philosophy of Objectivism. 

There is one event in the book that is unexpected and very disturbing to read.

I encourage those who fundamentally disagree with the core points of this book to read it!
