This one was much harder to get through. I wanted to read a religious book for the experience of reading a religious book. The first half wasn't bad. Augustine talks 
about his sinful affinities for wine, women, and petty theft. He also talks about how through this he still managed to move from Carthage to Rome and 
then to Milan as a teacher of English/Writing. He talks about how his mother was deeply religious and how her death affected his 
decision to finally join the catholic church and become a devout worshipper of the Lord. The second half reads like a bible in disguise. But, it does a good job of explaining western religious 
lines of reasoning. I feel like I learned a decent amount about why people choose to be religious and devote large amounts of their life to faith. 

Gotta go with "Dying Flower" for the photo rating. Augustine wrote this late in his life and it is clear by the end of it that he's writing it with preaching intentions.
Can't really hate too much on this book, religious devotion is respectable.
