Found this book around the house. It seemed interesting on the surface. Was a bit of a chore to read. The problem with ancient history is there is not much known about it. All that
can be done is read the old surviving written records and excavate some archeological sites. There is a significant amount of guesswork that goes into constructing theories and because of
that most conclusions that can be drawn are generalities that most likely happened within a somewhat precise time span, but nobody really knows for sure.

Not really my cup of tea type of book, but it was somewhat well written, and there are some interesting tidbits talking about ancient egypt in it. The book focusese around "The Sea Peoples"
who were this group of migrating/attacking/refugee/nobodyknows invaders who came conquered some land, and then left. The book talks about events that eventually leads to the bronze 
age collapse, but looking back on this read 1 month later I can't really say I get too much out of this book.

This book gets a photo rating of "BarkChips". You're looking at some scraps of what was once a tree but there is no way of knowing how tall the tree it belonged to was or 
any specifities about the actual tree because it has been grinded up into a bunch  of little pieces. This is much the nature of ancient history, except if you're lucky there will be remnents
of the past, there is mostly not even that.

Rating 3/10 Readability 4/10  Photo Score BarkChips/10
