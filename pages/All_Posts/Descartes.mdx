This book is not great. Barely Readable. 2 days of suffering. Renaissance tea sipping garbage. Boredom. Currently 2 weeks deep into Will Durant's Cesar and Christ
and I can't think of a single interesting thing that is memorable from reading this book. Truly a waste of life and time. Forcing people to read this book could 
be considered a form of cruel and unusual punishment.  

This book gets a photo rating of "Light Switch". I read this book and my brain was not turned on and I hadn't read enough philsophy books to understand every little detail that Descrates is saying.
and I still haven't read enough to really understand this book. Maybe I will read Meditations again in the future.e Discourses on Method is a bit dated.
