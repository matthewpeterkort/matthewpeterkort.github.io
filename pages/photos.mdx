What are we here for? What will I regret when I am near death? How can I better myself?
Where is the meaning in all of this? 

These are the somewhat large questions my Non Fiction reading journey aims to accomplish.

In October 2022 I started working in Portland, Oregon full time as a research Software Engineer as my first software job out of college.
I didn't want to get a place close to work yet or take care of a car.
So instead I commute in to work via MAX everyday. This leaves me with around 120 minutes of time to read everyday.

In college I didn't really study too much liberal arts, or philosophy or religion or ideological constructs that would help answer these big questions. I had to study them on my own and reach my own conclusions.
But I was out of college now. This 4 year slog of just trying to pass the class, learn some stuff, program some stuff,  get a job, and get out of University was over.

And what was ahead of me? 45+ years of full time work.

A couple weeks before I had witnessed my grandfather's last breaths alive. He died at 93 of natural causes. I remember sitting in one of the front pews of the church at his funeral watching some orthodox
clergymen go through their usual funeral service when when a wave of anxiety hit me. Although it might not seem like it in my youth, I am going to die one day.  

Echoes of the famous Metal Gear Solid 5 quote "Why are we here, just to suffer?" manifested the foundation of my journey of finding meaning from those who have existed before us.
After all there is a wealth of knowledge that can be learned from written history, that most people tend to take for granted.

Faced with this intangibley large unit of my life being subjugated by the 40 hour work week + a 10 hour commute week (at least for the time being) I realized I needed to find some meaning to the human condition of 
living on a floating rock hurling through seemingly empty space so that I could direct my efforts with purpose and find meaning in the routine monotony of life that was ahead of me.

So the purpose of this Site is to communicate my learnings / insights from my readings and also learn a little bit of web dev / take some photos / have an excuse to write.

Non Ficiton Philosopophy, History, Life Advice, Religion and Finance books are my main genre interests. I still struggle with fiction because it is not real. I need the facts.
I need a story that actually happened, or at least that millions of people believe happened.
