Very similar plot, the main difference is that Karenina did a public crime and
Raskolnikov did a private crime. Whereas Dostoevsky explains the internal struggles of the antagonist as his consciousness absorbs his being, Tolstoy shows this similar
process of grief and regret through how society/external characters / 3rd persion perspective. The effect is very different. Interesting read for sure. It&#x27;s a bit of a slow
burn, building in layers of plot. That&#x27;s why I enjoyed this type of genre so much. It shows the merits of making morally good choices, and especially well, it shows the utterly destructive
effects of treachery on its characters and society&#x27;s response as a whole. At the time.</p><p>Graded this C / Mid + but in reality it&#x27;s probably more of a Decent / B / B- type of book.</p><h4> Altered Carbon - Richard Morgan </h4><p>At this point had already had mostly postive experiences with non-fiction books so decided to dabble in some science fiction. Why not. This book was overall kindof
mediocre. Was very dystopian and showed a world where income inequality, technological supremacy and nihilism dominate society. The plot revolves around solving some
murder mystery for an ultra rich virtually immortal 700 year old &quot;meth&quot; who is annoyed that someone evil is messing with him. But in reality there is no good and evil in this
book. Everybody is evil in the book. The protagonist is painted to look like the shining light / hero who does everybody&#x27;s dirty work and emerges a great success in the end,
but in reality he&#x27;s just some hired mercenary who over the course of the book decides to do what is righteous through a few hundred pages of character development.</p><p>Mid -- C- / D+</p><h4> The Holy Bible - New International Version </h4><p>Took about 3 months to read this. Not ever reading the old testament ever again. It was the same 5 stories told 10 different
ways. Sure the first 3 books are iconic, but once you get into David / kings stories it gets very very very repetitive. The new testament was much more interesting. The whole thing seemed like more of a history book than what most people would think of a &quot;Bible&quot;. Sure there are many
stories that much can be learned from, but most stories either revolve around the themes of &quot;crime and punishment&quot; or making righteous decisions and being rewarded with delayed gratification.</p><p>There were definitely many parts that can / should be reread many times, but I&#x27;d say 80% of the bible could be separated into another book and the key points of the book would still be in tact.
Sure the bible has its criticisms. It is not a perfect book by any means. That said, there is a good reason why this book is earth&#x27;s best seller for almost 2000 years in a row.
Don&#x27;t sleep on or disrespect religion. Everyone is mortal. From dust to dust. The universe is the closest thing to eternity one will ever witness.
God isn&#x27;t a bad place to start. Although nobody is perfect, if everyone was a God fearing individual many of society&#x27;s greatest problems would be significantly lessened.</p><p>Not going to give a rating</p><h4> Resistance to Evil by Force - Ivan Ilyin </h4><p>Couldn&#x27;t really get through this one. It was supposed to be a critique of Tolstoy&#x27;s regligous pacifism and a rationale for violence given a
certain key set of qualifiers, but I couldn&#x27;t really get behind it. Was very boring and abstract. Like most philosophy books it never really
got into particular examples. What&#x27;s the point of talking in abstracts if you can&#x27;t apply it to realy life. I don&#x27;t know maybe I&#x27;m just too
dense for this type of reading.</p><p>A solid D-/F</p><h4> In Order to Live - Yeonmi Park </h4><p>These types of female &quot;coming of age&quot; stories tend to be incredibly boring for me, but this one was actually decent. The editor was the real MVP of this book. Although
Yeonmi&#x27;s story was captivating I&#x27;d say the most intersting part of this book was here ability to contrast the different cultural experiences between North Korea, China, South Korea, and America.
Each place seems to be uniquely different in it&#x27;s own right, with its own challenges and its own set of rules. Another thing I picked up from this book is the ability to be grateful for what you have.
If you&#x27;re not starving, be grateful. If you have shelter, be grateful. If you are not a political  prisoner, be grateful. If you are in decent health, be grateful. If you have enough money to provide for
your basic needs, be grateful. Life can almost always be worse, until you&#x27;re dead.</p><p>Enjoyed this one -- A- / B+</p><h4> Think and Grow Rich - Napolean Hill </h4><p>Very provactive title indeed, but it strangely didn&#x27;t disappoint too much. Title should be replaced with &quot;Think, Act. Act. Act. Keep working and then maybe someday when you are 40+ you might have some money&quot;.
But that title wouldn&#x27;t sell. But that&#x27;s what it tells you to do. Still, it&#x27;s not that bad of a book. Towards the end it gets a bit kooky. but this book tells many of stories about the key players of the
industrial revolution, Henry Ford, Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Eddison, the founding of Fedex, Southwest Airlines. Overall the book is intersting, quick read.</p><p>A solid B</p><h4> Dune - Frank Herbert </h4><p>Currently on page 630/800 and it feels as though the book is just beginning to really heat up. Most of the book is spent
giving The main characteers &quot;tests&quot; and describing the destruction and evil of higher powers in the polticial chain of command.
This book describes modern politics to a certain extent in a rather frightening way. The character development of Paul and Jessica is well done, and
the handful of side characters are also sculpted well, something I hadn&#x27;t seen in the Russian Literature that I had
read previously. It also shows the virtues of western morals / values in a more modern approachable way through the contrast of the Harkonnen leadership,
particularly the evil Baron Vladimir Harkonnen vs. Paul and Jessica&#x27;s approach to leadership of the fremen and Leto&#x27;s approach to leadership of the Atreides.</p><p>EDIT:</p><p>Currently Finished Dune and Dune Messiah, the second book in the 6 book series. If a russian had written this series, the first and second book would
have been 1000+ page tragedy in which the protagonist slowly crumbles from atop their mountain of greatness, but, Herbert does the great service of leaving
the tragedy aspect of Paul to the second book. Personally, I enjoyed both books equally as much.</p><p>For the first book it takes around 600 pages for the book to really get cooking and then the ending felt a bit rushed. It would&#x27;ve been nice to see some back and
forth between Paul and the Baron of the Harkonnens but instead what you got was gigachad Paul Atreides swinging his big powerful fremen army around, summoning sand storms,
and kicking butt. Which was enjoyable, but a bit unrealistic.</p><p>This is easily top 3 books read this year A / A- territory</p><h4> Dune Messiah - Frank Herbert </h4><p>The second book was alot more intresting from a thematic perspective. In the first book Paul is made out to be a literal god and all of his actions align to this godly persona,
in the second book the complete opposite is portrayed.  Although Paul has these godly powers of seeing the future he is still hosted in a very human, malleable body with human like
emotions and human like tendancies. He struggles with holding up the empire with his royal wife and his actual wife, and battles with the hard choices that he sees ahead. In the first book,
Herbert paints the primary antagonist, Vladimir Harkonnen to be some ruthless idiot, in the second book, Herbert paints the primary antagonist to be Paul himself.</p><p>Oh boy the layers of plot that comes from this choice. The first half of the book was a bit annoying to read because you&#x27;re thinking about all of the choices that could have been made to keep the empire together without having to lose what ended up getting lost.
Paul could&#x27;ve had kids with the other wife, appeasing her, so that he could also have kids with his primary wife. He could&#x27;ve told most of the conspirator characters to get lost and take a hike. He could see the future.
But aparently he was also stunlocked into doing most of what the visions depict. He sees his own downfall ahead of time yet can&#x27;t act against it. This seems like poor writing to me.
But then again, it reminded me of the plot lines of 19th century Russian literature, and this I enjoy reading. This is probably the weakest part of the whole book. Every human has free will.</p><p>This is probably why most people reading the second book didn&#x27;t like it. They didn&#x27;t sign up for some proper depression reading. They wanted big explosion, victory, battle, conquest, adventure, and they got none of that.
They got an Emperror slowly melting into a puddle of nothing for 300 pages. But personally, I can enjoy some well crafted depression writing. Very nice.</p><p>B+ / A- territory</p></div><footer class="jsx-2447ca1c11803f07"><small class="jsx-2447ca1c11803f07"><time class="jsx-2447ca1c11803f07">2024</time> © MAX BOOK BYTES</small></footer></article></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/posts/Year_End_2023","query":{},"buildId":"QHL_Jl-Cibr3LPUMuEN8z","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
