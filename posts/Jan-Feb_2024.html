From doing a bit of research after reading the book most people say that this book sets up the rest of the series.
Well then I have no reason to read the rest of the series. This book is entirely character development, and not even good character devleopment either. Nothing really happens.
Half of the book is spent covering Alia&#x27;s tragic possion by the Barron Harkonnen, and the other part of the book is spent mulling over lady Jessica&#x27;s relationships with the Gesserits and
Leto and Ghanmina&#x27;s &quot;coming of age&quot; progressions. Truly the worst parts of all genres with this one. Dude really just wrote filler for 600 pages. Truly a chore to get through it.
There were some 20 page sections that were interesting, but most of the book seemed like building and tying somewhat unrelated plots together in an efforting to make the next
books in the series make more sense. I don&#x27;t enjoy this writing style at all.</p><p>D</p><h4> The Gulag Archipelago (Abridged) -- Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn </h4><p>Anything could be better after reading Children of Dune and Gulag Archipelago did not disappoint! I don&#x27;t mind reading books like this because I know that
if I ever had to live in a totalitarian society I  have the type of personality that wouldn&#x27;t last very long so
I need to mentally prepare myself ahead of time for the gulag conditions if they ever happen.</p><p>That said this was a very informative read. It&#x27;s hard to give this book a proper review because the nature of the writing is so unapologetically raw and honest
you cannot place judgement on this type of non fiction writing. Most people will probably find this book boring but I found it quite interseting. Solzhenitsyn
really gives an all facets review of the Soviet criminal justice system from the 1920s to the 1950s ish. From arrest to exile, or death. Death was part of living
in such harsh conditions. There is a reason why this book was so popular back in the day.</p><p>It sheds light on the realities of living in extremist governments, and in my opinion more people should read books like this.</p><p>a solid A</p><h4> The 7 habits of highly effective people -- Stephen R. Covey </h4><p>This book has been great so far. Halfway through and it is the best self help book I&#x27;ve ever read and it&#x27;s not even close.
Most books in this self help genre talk in abstracts and say stuff like &quot;If you want to start doing x then do it now&quot; and stuff like that.
This book goes a little deeper and inspects the root motivations for wanting to do x and then shows how to add discipline and structure to the
busy modern life. It teaches things like priotizing urgent vs. important tasks, and ballancing productive output (golden eggs) with taking care
of yourself (golden goose). Best of all I think this book takes concepts that many other self help books talk about and distills them into simple
actionable items / concepts that when done together create a much more meaningful result. Really great and I am confident that the rest of the
book will continue to deliver.</p><p>EDIT: the rest of the book did deliver. Although It has been a few months and my memory can&#x27;t remember any super specific details,
this book is worth reading more than once.</p><p>a solid A</p></div><footer class="jsx-2447ca1c11803f07"><small class="jsx-2447ca1c11803f07"><time class="jsx-2447ca1c11803f07">2024</time> Â© MAX BOOK BYTES</small></footer></article></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/posts/Jan-Feb_2024","query":{},"buildId":"QHL_Jl-Cibr3LPUMuEN8z","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
