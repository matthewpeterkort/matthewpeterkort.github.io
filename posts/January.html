Even with the long introduction talking about the concept of taoism,
It just didn&#x27;t make much sense to me. It felt like stoicism + follow superiors + conform to society. The text
itself is pretty short and chock full with contradictions. Not a total waste of time, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m
the type of person that can really get much out of taoism. But not going to judge it off of one book,
theres probably more to it but I&#x27;m not motivated to find out and read more taoist works.</p><p>3/10... not my cup of tea</p><h4> Marx and Engels- Communist Manifesto </h4><br/><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Communist-Manifesto-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140447571/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3HH43C3KF4JMH&amp;keywords=communist+manifesto+penguin+classics&amp;qid=1677992564&amp;sprefix=communist+manifesto+pengiun+classi%2Caps%2C149&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank"> Pengiun Classics Communist Manifesto Amazon Buy Link</a><p>This one was quite interesting. The introduction was 180 pages and it talked about the European poltical cimate
in the mid 1800s and why these marxist ideas were formed/ how they were formed and how/why they got popular.
The text itself isn&#x27;t really my cup of tea. Sure if you&#x27;ve been delt a terrible hand in life and don&#x27;t have much
to make it great communism can be appealing but in general if you have a good path in your life it&#x27;s hard to think that
you should believe in this type of thing. Now granted back then the standard of living was much worse for the majority of the
working populace, so it would make sense why this ideology was more powerful. But it&#x27;s not like communism hadn&#x27;t been tried many many
countries. Then end result is usually mass starvation/famine/death. It&#x27;s a utopia that goes against all human nature.</p><p>I can see how this book could normally be quite boring. But, with the 200 page introduction I now understand alot more about the physical text itself
and the whole reading experience/context really helps enjoy this piece of history.</p><p>Great theoretically, not as great in practice 7.1/10, C-</p><h4> Cicero- On Life and Death </h4><p>This book was good, but it was a bit hard to read. The back half of it was more intersting. I didn&#x27;t get much out of the
first part Tuscan Disputations. I would rank this a C grade Stoic text. There are better stoic works. This one fallows the format
of a guided conversation to Atticus and Bfutus, which makes it feel more like a Plato&#x27;s Republic style of work.
Not my favorite type of writing style. Overall it explains most of the guiding principles of stoicism, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it
as a first stoic book. Cicero spends most of this book reflecting on his life in Roman Society while trying to advise younger
reads how to live their lives.</p><p>Mid Mid Mid Mid Mid Mid Mid Mid 4/10</p><h4> Seneca- Letters from a Stoic </h4><p>This book I really didn&#x27;t get much out of. People say that you must read alot of philsophy and then come back to this book to get any
kind of understanding. I assure you I read every word and every sentence and every paragraph, but I cannot really tell you about any of the
thoughts/ideas that they conveyed. Most of the letters were pretty short or uninteresting so I really didn&#x27;t end up picking up much from this.
I think it also doesn&#x27;t help that letters in general are usually very dependant on contextual facts and interpersonal relations between people.
These are two things that I don&#x27;t really know how to attain from a text written 2000+ years ago. Would not recommend this book unless you
have read alot on stoicism/ancient roman culture and now about everything that is going on in Rome at the time.</p><p>This book was definately a fly-over for me. Maybe one day I&#x27;ll read this again after I have read many more books from this era. 2/10</p><h4> Epictetus- Discourses and selected Writings </h4><p>This book was great! probably the 2nd best stoic text I ever read behind meditations. Epictetus just knows how to write.
Or maybe the translation is really good. I think after I read this book I felt alot better about the concept of death.
For a long time I was bothered by it but I think this book really helped me out alot. Some people like to say that stoicism
is accepting the fact that as part of nature, you will have to take the ultimate L of dying, and it teaches you have to lose on your own terms.
I&#x27;m not eplaining this very well. The hardest part to me about stoicism is recognizing what is in your control and what isn&#x27;t.  The stoics never really
explain this very well. They seem to be better at explaining how to cope with the Losses. There are points in this book when you just stop reading and think about what
Epictetus is saying because there are alot of quotable lines in this book. It&#x27;s not all sunshines and rainbows, there are boring parts, but I strongly
recommend this book to anyone trying to understand stoicism. Like most philosophical books you really have to take your time reading it to understand what is
being said but I think for this book it is actually worth doing.</p><p>Exceptional, 2nd to only Meditations. 9/10</p></div><footer class="jsx-2447ca1c11803f07"><small class="jsx-2447ca1c11803f07"><time class="jsx-2447ca1c11803f07">2024</time> Â© MAX BOOK BYTES</small></footer></article></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/posts/January","query":{},"buildId":"7VR0i4cAAE3tYtSWF1_XJ","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
